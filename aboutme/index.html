    <h2>Kevin Bingham</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Kevin. I have two kids and a beautiful wife. I am currently going to school at Brigham Young University Idaho. I decided to go back to school so that I could better provide for my family.I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is a big change for me. I was going into the medical field before I changed majors. I studied exercise physiology and was a practicing Licensed Massage therapist. I work at Rexburg Motorsports as a parts specialist.</p>
    <p>I have a few things that I enjoy doing. I enjoy sports. If you can play it I enjoy it. I enjoy reading. My favorite genre is fantasy. If I had to choose a favorite book I would probably say Dawn of Wonder. I enjoy playing games, be they video, card or board games.I enjoy watching good wholesome shows and movies. I especially enjoy action and comedy.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ for my whole life. I served a mission in Sacramento California and loved it. I have a testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and the Savior. In the past when I had really hard times there was a scripture that I always turned to it was in 2 Nephi 2:24 which teaches that all things are done in the wisdom of our Heavenly Father. He truly is wise and loves us. He wants the best for each of us.</p>
